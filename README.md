# BetterSplitwise

Are you one of those people who doesn't want to install a whole fuckin' app with signup and shit just to figure out how much you need to pay your friends or how much they owe you ? Then this app is for you.
Introducing Better split - A no hassle bill splitting app, way better than Splitwise. Ergo, BetterSplit

## How to use

- Visit: https://bettersplit.netlify.app/
- Enter head count and hit "GO"
- Enter how much each participant spent and "BALLANCE AWAY"
- You can always hit "RESET" if shit goes south

## Why the dist folder ?

'cause it's hosted on netlify free tier which has a limit on monthly build time. So I'm gon' save all that build time and publish without a worry in the world.
